# selkies-de

Minimal selkies example for german keyboard layout, where every key kinda
works. The keyboard layout is `de`. There are still issues with dead keys. They
can not be used to compose, but you can enter the actual characters by pressing
the key twice (circumflex, dead_acute and dead_grave
(<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>Â´</kbd>)).

# disclaimer

Do not use this. I patch the latest selkies release on the fly, so it will
almost certainly break with the next release.
